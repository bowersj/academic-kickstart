## A Brief History

The history of data modeling is a broad topic, one that has been discussed
in much more detail than we will go into here. So why start with the 
history of data modeling? Well, because it provides a context for the 
rest of the lessons in this course, as well as helps to orient the less
experienced modeler. So, lets dive right in.

_A Long Time Ago in a Galaxy Far Far Away..._

Data Modeling was born. Setting aside the drama, data modeling has been 
around for a while so what is it and why should you care? [Data modeling
is a process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling), wait what? 
That's right, data models evolve over time as do requirements so that 
means you have to work with and tweak your model again and again, 
even when you think it is finished and ready to go. That is probably one
of the most misunderstood parts of modeling data, you are never done.
There will always be changes that need to be made to your model to 
accommodate a new requirement or to improve performance. So, think of
it as a set of tasks you repeat over and over until you have refined
your thinking, and your model, to the point where your requirements are
met, and your boss is happy. That is until your boss comes back and 
either adds a new requirement or changes a pre-existing one, which will 
happen more than once. 

Ok data modeling is a process, but what's a model?
This is more difficult to define, here's what [wikipedia has to say](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model):

>A data model (or datamodel) is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.

Ok, what does all this academic mumbo-jumbo really mean? Basically, a 
model is a way you can organize your thoughts, build rules, and relate
those rules to the real world. Let's look at an example, speed (and no 
not the drug). There is a whole discipline of science dedicated to 
studying motion, or speed, its called physics. Physics has rules, in
fact some of those rules are so foundational they are given names and then 
sometimes they are promoted to law status, Newton's 3 laws (or rules) for
example. With these rules you can then look at the world through force 
diagrams and vectors. This allows you to predicate how something will 
work and what it will do even before it actually happens. This is the 
power of models, they allow you to break down the world around us into
small parts and combine those small parts to get bigger parts. Eventually
though, just as in science, there are problems found with a portion of the
rules which leads to a drastic change of thinking. An example of this is 
Einstein's theory of relativity, it changed how physicists viewed the 
universe, or in other words it changed their model of the universe. So,
why does this relate to data modeling? Simple, because data modeling is a
science, and like every science it has changed of the years to accommodate
new ideas. That is what we will discuss in this article, how data modeling
has changed over the years.
