While your modeling a document have you ever asked yourself, 

 * How would I model that?
 * How can I make my model better? 
 * How can I make my model more dynamic? 

If so, this course is for you. Before we jump in their
needs to be a brief history lesson, so we understand where document modeling 
came from. After we go through a brief history we will jump into what is a
document and therefore what is data, in the context of document modeling.
Once we have defined what data is, at least in a general sense, we can jump
into what questions you need to be asking yourself as you model. Finally, we
jump into a possible future of document modeling.

Feel free to jump around and check out parts of the course but keep in mind, 
it's meant to be read in order.

Finally, this is a work in progress and feed back would be greatly appreciated!

Let's get started with lesson 1, A Brief History of Data Modeling.
