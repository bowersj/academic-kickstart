While your modeling a document have you ever asked yourself, 

 * How would I model that?
 * How can I make my model better? 
 * How can I make my model more dynamic? 

If so, this course is for you. Before we jump in their
needs to be a brief history lesson, so we understand where document modeling 
came from which will help us understand why we do things in certain ways.
After we go through a brief history we will jump into what is a document 
and therefore what is data, in the context of document modeling. Once we have
defined what data is, at least in a general sense, we can jump into what 
questions you need to be asking yourself as you model. Finally, we jump into
a possible future of document modeling.

Feel free to jump around and check out parts of the course but keep in mind, it 
should read in order if you want to get the most out this work.

Finally, this is a work in progress and feed back would be greatly appreciated!

Let's get started with lesson 1, A Brief History of Data Modeling.
